<h1>Specific Coordinates</h1>

<p>

    Positional is a location app that works on three important information of a specific region

</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Latitude</b> (±90)</li>
    <li><b>Longitude</b> (±180)</li>
    <li><b>Timezone</b> (Continent/Region or UTC)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    These three information comprises to almost every information shown in the app. Latitude and
    Longitude
    are a pair of fractional numbers and the Timezone is the <strong>ID</strong> of the region whose
    time
    offset is to be calculated. Using these three pieces of information carefully you can calculate
    almost
    infinite amount of geological information of any region around the world and this is what makes
    this
    tool very powerful and also very flexible at the same time.
</p>

<br>
<h2>Understanding the layout</h2>

<p>
    Once you click the <i>Use Specified Coordinates</i> in the <i>Settings</i> panel, a small window
    will
    appear containing four input columns for <b>Address</b>, <b>Latitude</b>, <b>Longitude</b> and
    <b>Timezone</b>.

    <br>
    <br>

    These four columns takes the information as their name suggests and when you press
    <strong>SET</strong>
    all these inputs will be saved to be used globally means anything you've entered here will be
    used across
    every panel of the app and these information you've entered will be used to calculate all the
    information
    such as <b>Sun Position</b> and <b>Twilight</b>
</p>

<br>
<h2>How to use</h2>

<h4>
    <li>Address</li>
</h4>

<p>
    Address column is optional and can be skipped if you don't know the information but the rest
    three columns
    are compulsory but it is advisable to start the input from address itself because if the address
    is correct
    the app will fetch the Latitude and Longitude automatically from the Geocoder's server and will
    save some
    time and user's efforts.

    <br>
    <br>

    Although you can, you do not need to enter the full address of a particular region, small pieces
    like
    <i>region name</i>, <i>pin code</i>, or a well known <i>landmark</i> will work too
</p>

<h4>
    <li>Latitude and Longitude</li>
</h4>

<p>
    Coordinates are compulsory and are required in fractional number format meaning they should not
    contain
    any special character, letter or any unicode character that is not a valid decimal number.

    <br>
    <br>

    The range of latitude is -90.0 to +90.0 likewise the range of longitude is -180.0 to +180.0 and
    you can
    enter any number with as many decimal places as you want and it will be considered valid as long
    as it
    falls within the specified range of the respective fields.
</p>

<h4>
    <li>Time zone</li>
</h4>

<p>
    Time zone is compulsory, case sensitive and are limited to the options provided in the list so
    it is recommended
    to select from the list only. The format of the timezone id is fairly tricky to use, it can be
    <i>Continent/Region</i>,
    <i>UTC</i>, and maybe <i>GMT Offset</i> and all of the options are included inside the list.

    <br>
    <br>

    Timezones are a powerful tool to use and when combined with coordinates it can be used as a time
    reference of
    any region despite of the region used in coordinates such as if you have used Tokyo in address
    coordinates and
    selected the timezone of <i>America/New_York</i> the app will shift all the time reference to
    timezone of the
    New York and will show like hen the sun is going to rise in Tokyo from the time reference of New
    York and if you
    have used <i>Asia/Tokyo</i> as timezone, then it will show the all the information of Tokyo
    using the time reference
    of Tokyo.

    <br>
    <br>

    Hence it is very important to use timezones carefully else it can show misleading information
    and lead to
    various miscalculations.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisite</h2>

<p>
    Although as a developer I crafted this application to be as easy to use as possible, this app
    still expects some form of
    existing knowledge of how various location related information works, how to correctly use
    timezone to
    get the correct time of the given region and various knowledge of about local and international
    standards of
    time and coordinates.
