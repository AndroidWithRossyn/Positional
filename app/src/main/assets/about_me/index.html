        <h3>Hi,</h3>
        <br>
        <p class="text">
            I'm Hamza Rizwan, a student and I love messing around on computers resulting in which I
            learned so many things in the past few years, and as of today I am all into
            developing great-looking apps.

            <br>
            <br>

            Currently, I am developing a few apps named Inure and Felicit for Android.
        </p>

        <h2>Why this app?</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="text">
            A few months ago I started learning Android app development, and I needed something to
            work and practice on, and the Positional app is that project. It was created solely to
            help me learn and progress gradually into the complex software development phase, and I
            still have a lot to cover, and my lack of knowledge in some subjects is the reason why
            some features aren't very optimized yet, but I'm positive that soon they will be.
