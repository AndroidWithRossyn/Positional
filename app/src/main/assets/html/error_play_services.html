<h1>Play Services Issue</h1>

<p>
    Google Play Services dependencies are not found in your device which this app requires to make
    the maps and some other features work. Contact your device manufacturer for further information
    and if you think this is a mistake then contact developer to get this problem
    fixed as soon as possible.

    <br>
    <br>

    If your device cannot utilize Google Play services, you can switch to Open Source Maps which can
    be changed from the <b>Settings</b> panel.
