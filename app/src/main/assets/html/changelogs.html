    <p>
        I have planned a road map for the Build86 and here are the things that I would like to add
        in this version

        <br>
        <br>

        • Different font styles for the whole app <br>
        • Option to use of Rotation Vector for compass <br>
        • Make the app full screen <br>
        • New custom bottom navigation style to make the app more new panels friendly in future <br>
        • Possibly allow rotation of the app by default <br>

        <br>
        <br>

        These features are quite tempting and can make the app even more appealing and user friendly
        but implementing them may take time. Any possible bug reports should be posted on GitHub or
        via Email and will be added to the queue until the build is finalized.
    </p>
