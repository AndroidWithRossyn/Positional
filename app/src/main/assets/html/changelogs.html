    <p>
        Here are the few issues I have encountered till now in Build74 that I will be taking care of
        in the upcoming build.

        <br>
        <br>

        • Underlying view hierarchy issues<br>
        • Direction indicator<br>
        • Option to skip saving of custom location<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Made popup pages a bit larger for easier readings

        Fixed that old compass rotation issue and in the meantime added and new bloom skin that I
        personally like :)

    </p>

    <p>
        Added more bloom themes and a new skin selector panel just like Clock needle ones and fixed
        an animation issue while changing bloom skin and also text color change is smoother.
