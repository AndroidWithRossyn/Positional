    <h2>Build74</h2>
    <h4>Update 22 Feb, 2021</h4>

    <p>
        Updated all the threads inside the fragments.
    </p>

        I think I found a better way to run independent threads inside an activity scope and solve
        the crashes. Right now I am working on <b>Specified Coordinates</b> popup dialog since it
        was most prone to be getting crashed and so far it seems that it is working without any
        issue. If this solution is reliable I will just have to rewrite the codes of all the threads
        used in this application.

        During the test in past few day here are a few things I found that needs my attention. The
        use of <b>Context</b> inside a Coroutine is a problematic approach because currently the
        coroutines used are independent threads and they don't stop when the view is closed which
        eventually leads to app getting stopped/crashed. This will be my primary objective to be
        addressed in this build.
