    <p>
        During the test in past few day here are a few things I found that needs my attention. The
        use of <b>Context</b> inside a Coroutine is a problematic approach because currently the
        coroutines used are independent threads and they don't stop when the view is closed which
        eventually leads to app getting stopped. This will be my primary objective to be addressed
        in this build.
