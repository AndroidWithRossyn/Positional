    <h2>Build78</h2>
    <h3>Status: In development</h3>

    <p>
        Updated how map camera movements works and removed the 10 second delay every time the map is
        moved and in respect of that added a toggle to enable disable camera auto center
        automatically. Apart from that it will also save your last map's zoom and tilt values and
        will begin from there when the map reopens or just there instead of auto zooming back to the
        location.

    <p>
        Added media keys option in GPS Menu panel, touch to full screen for map and fixed some bugs.
