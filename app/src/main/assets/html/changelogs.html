    <h2>Build74</h2>
    <h4>Last Updated: 24 Feb, 2021</h4>

    <p>
        Redesigned <b>Settings</b> panel to get rid of clutters

        Fixed crash when <b>Coordinates</b> is clicked in GPS panel. It was happening due to
        unavailability of location.

        Following the popup menu redesigning, I felt that other menus are lacking something too so I
        redesigned the whole app's menu and they are now more elegant.

    <p>
        Redesigned the popup menu of the app, earlier it didn't go very well with the app's design.

        It looks something like this, the left one is the older design and the right one is the
        updated one

    <p>
        Updated all the threads inside the fragments.
    </p>

    <p>
        I think I found a better way to run independent threads inside an activity scope and solve
        the crashes. Right now I am working on <b>Specified Coordinates</b> popup dialog since it
        was most prone to be getting crashed and so far it seems that it is working without any
        issue. If this solution is reliable I will just have to rewrite the codes of all the threads
        used in this application.
    </p>

    <p>
        During the test in past few day here are a few things I found that needs my attention. The
        use of <b>Context</b> inside a Coroutine is a problematic approach because currently the
        coroutines used are independent threads and they don't stop when the view is closed which
        eventually leads to app getting stopped/crashed. This will be my primary objective to be
        addressed in this build.
