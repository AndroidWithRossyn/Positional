    <h2>Build86</h2>
    <h3>Status: In development</h3>
    <h3>Last Updated: 24 April, 2021</h3>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p>
        I have planned a road map for the Build86 and here are the things that I would like to add
        in this version

        <br>
        <br>

        • Different font styles for the whole app <br>
        • Option to use of Rotation Vector for compass <br>
        • Make the app full screen <br>
        • New custom bottom navigation style to make the app more new panels friendly in future <br>
        • Possibly allow rotation of the app by default <br>

        <br>
        <br>

        These features are quite tempting and can make the app even more appealing and user friendly
        but implementing them may take time. Any possible bug reports should be posted on GitHub or
        via Email and will be added to the queue until the build is finalized.
    </p>

    <p>
        Added home screen widget for <b>Sun Times</b> and it uses both 12 and 24 hour time formats
        and these configurations can be changed from the clock menu since this panel is directly
        related with the clock panel. It will be available in both versions.

        <br>

    <p>
        Added option to adjust physical properties of the compass based on the real physics formulas
        to create life-like compass movements and removed the older sensor speed option.
