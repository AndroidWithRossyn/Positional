    <h2>Build74</h2>
    <h4>Development yet to begin</h4>

    <p>
        During the test in past few day here are a few things I found that needs my attention. The
        use of <b>Context</b> inside a Coroutine is a problematic approach because currently the
        coroutines used are independent threads and they don't stop when the view is closed which
        eventually leads to app getting stopped/crashed. This will be my primary objective to be
        addressed
        in this build.
