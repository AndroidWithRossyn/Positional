<h1>Found Issue?</h1>

<p>
    If you think something is not working as expected, encountered an unexpected behavior, have some
    complaints regarding the app or found a problem/bug then please do not hesitate to file an issue
    on GitHub or simply email me, Your little effort can move the app one step closer to being the
    the best version of itself :)
</p>

<h3>Responsibilities</h3>

<p>
    Although any kind of report is fine, it is still nice to have some extra information passes
    along with the issue. This information could be
</p>

<li>Device Name</li>
<li>Device Model</li>
<li>Android Version</li>
<li>App Version</li>
<li>Screenshots showing the problem if any</li>

<p>
    Any of the information can help the developer find the source of the problem more quickly and
    will increase the chances of getting the problems fixed in lesser time.
