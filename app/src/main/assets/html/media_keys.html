<h1>Using Media Keys</h1>

<p>
    The GPS panel has an option to override default media keys function from the device and use them
    to few features of the app. The different use cases are mentioned below.

    <br>
    <br>

    These button events will only work if the <b>Use Media Keys</b> option is toggled on from the
    <b>GPS Menu</b>
</p>

<h3>
    <li>Volume Up</li>
</h3>

<p>
    This will zoom in the currently visible location on the map. This option will zoom-in the center
    of the map regardless of the marker's position on the screen. For centering the marker use <b>Location</b>
    on the header panel.
</p>

<h3>
    <li>Volume Down</li>
</h3>

<p>
    Same behavior as <b>Volume Up</b> key except it will zoom out the map.
</p>

<h3>
    <li>Play/Pause</li>
</h3>

<p>
    Such buttons are available via external media devices such as Bluetooth controller. Pressing
    this key will move the map's camera to the marker meaning the marker or the current location
    will be centered on the display panel.
