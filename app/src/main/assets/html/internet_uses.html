<h1>Internet Uses</h1>

<p>
    This app works offline in almost every cases but some features require internet access for
    downloading data that are not possible to ship along with the application itself. The list of
    places where this app utilizes internet connection are
</p>

<h3>
    <li>Maps</li>
</h3>

<p>
    All the maps data shown in the app are downloaded from Google Maps servers and requires a mild
    bandwidth uses to download the sufficient map data to show the required information to the
    users.
    The maps does not use so much internet data but bandwidth uses can increase if satellite mode is
    used.
</p>

<h3>
    <li>Geocoder</li>
</h3>

<p>
    Geocoder is a default Android API that allows the app to convert Latitude and Longitude data
    into a meaningful address line. Using this API requires a proper internet connection as this app
    updates the address every second or until a new updated location data is available. The
    bandwidth uses for this API is very low and often limited to 1-5 kilobytes per request only,
    depending on the size of the address. This API is also use to perform reverse Geocoding in
    specified coordinates to convert address into proper coordinates.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Note:</b> There maybe other uses of the internet such as logs collection, push notification,
    license verification but such actions are carried out by the System and not the app. The app
    only uses and acts accordingly based on the information received.
