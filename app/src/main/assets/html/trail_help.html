<h1>Trail</h1>

<p>
    Trail panel is used to add markers on the map for any current event from the beginning to end
    with unique icons and notes to create a journal. This documentation explains how to properly use
    trail panel.
</p>

<h2>Understanding Layout</h2>

<h3>Toolbar/Topbar/Appbar</h3>

<p>
    The toolbar providers 3 panel related options.
</p>

<h4>
    <li>Add</li>
</h4>

<p>
    It adds a new fresh trail and also sets it to editable trail by default.
</p>

<h4>
    <li>Trails</li>
</h4>

<p>
    It opens list of all the trails saved up till now and can be used to browse the trails and set
    any trail to be editable on the app if required. Long pressing the icon will open the current
    trail data directly.
</p>

<h4>
    <li>Menu</li>
</h4>

<p>
    Opens Trail panel menu.
</p>

<br>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>
    On the right side of the screen a vertical toolbar is given which can be used to add marker on
    the map.
</p>

<h4>
    <li>Align</li>
</h4>

<p>
    Change the gravity of the tools dock between left and and right.
</p>

<h4>
    <li>Location</li>
</h4>

<p>
    Centers the current location on the map.
</p>

<h4>
    <li>Wrap/Unwrap</li>
</h4>

<h4>
    <li>Compass</li>
</h4>

<p>
    Use compass sensor to rotate pin on the map, if disabled location bearing is used. Using compass
    is ideal in scenarios where the person is walking and if the device is moving fast say in a car
    or train using bearing is more preferred.
</p>

<p>
    Clicking the icon will try to wrap all the markers within the screen bounds. If the markers are
    scattered out over long distances then the wrapping will zoom out the map to its max limit.
    Clicking the unwrap will move the camera to its previous location.
</p>

<h4>
    <li>Marker Icons</li>
</h4>

<p>
    These are the set of icons that are given to add contextual meaning to the current marker.
    Clicking any of the icon will open a popup window asking for name and notes for the current
    marker, if no input is provided a blank value is used. Once saved the marker will automatically
    be added on the current location of the device. Long pressing any of the icons will
    quickly add a marker on the map skipping the name and notes process but beware any such entry
    does not contain any memorable or identifiable information except for icon and coordinates.
</p>

<h4>
    <li>Clear Marker</li>
</h4>

<p>
    This button will remove the most recent marker by default.
</p>

<h1>
    Notes
</h1>

<p>
    Trail panel is still in beta and currently only support Google Maps, support of Open Street Maps
    maybe added in future. There maybe some errors or lack some options but any such issues will be
    fixed gradually and if you got any, you can also suggest some ideas to improve the trail panel.
