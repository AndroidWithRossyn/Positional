        Fixed that old compass rotation issue and in the meantime added and new bloom skin that I
        personally like :)

    <p>
        Added more bloom themes and a new skin selector panel just like Clock needle ones and fixed
        an animation issue while changing bloom skin and also text color change is smoother.

        Replaced all tacky splash screens with better and premium looking ones as in this
        screenshot. Now the colors are more subtle, vibrant and smoother to eyes, deleted
        all the splash screens containing shapes with sharp or pointy corners corners, having
        rendering issues and uneven color distributions that are hard to look at :)
