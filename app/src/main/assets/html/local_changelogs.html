    <p>
        Added home screen widget for <b>Sun Times</b> and it uses both 12 and 24 hour time formats
        and these configurations can be changed from the clock menu since this panel is directly
        related with the clock panel. It will be available in both versions.

        Added option to adjust physical properties of the compass based on the real physics formulas
        to create life-like compass movements and removed the older sensor speed option.
