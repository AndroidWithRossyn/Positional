    <h2>Change Logs</h2>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p>
        Added home screen widget for <b>Sun Times</b> and it uses both 12 and 24 hour time formats
        and these configurations can be changed from the clock menu since this panel is directly
        related with the clock panel. It will be available in both versions.

        <br>

    </p>

    <p>
        Added option to adjust physical properties of the compass based on the real physics formulas
        to create life-like compass movements and removed the older sensor speed option.

             width="100%">
    </p>

    <p>
        Removed material toolbar from every panel in favour of making the app translucent and add a
        transparent status bar feature and create a better simplified light interface.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Lite</b> version's apk is now smaller in size and uses a different art for splash screen
        in favour of making it a sustainable standalone application. Even if it is free it should
        look good to the eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Added two new physics based motion type for clock needle and random initial animations
        based on the needle position and rotation angle.

    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Development Status</b> removed from the settings due to its unnecessary nature.
    </p>

    <p>
        Added option to toggle seconds precision in Clock panel.
    </p>

    <p>
        Added toggle to disable the use of <b>Physical Properties</b> in <i>Compass</i> panel as
        fallback mechanism for devices that suffer from compass disappearing issue due to the
        implementation of newer compass framework that mimics life-like compass rotation.

    <p>
        Added toggle to enable/disable bearing based rotation for map. Its use with <b>Fused
        Location Provider</b> is not intended due to various reasons.
    </p>

    <p>
        Added widget for moon illumination.
