<h1>Physical Properties of Compass</h1>

<p>
    Earlier versions of Positional uses a relatively simple formula to adjust compass motion, it was
    working fine except the problems it poses were severe. The current method uses angular motion
    equation of magnetic dipole in magnetic field to implement such movement to the dial. It mimics
    the real-life compass movements based on various physical factors and this panel is for
    manipulating those factors and create a life-like compass motion.

    <br>
    <br>

    There are three sliders given in the panel, they adjust oscillation, damping and responsiveness
    of the compass dial and the behavior varies as the value changes.
</p>

<br>
<h3>Rotational Inertia</h3>

<p>
    Its range is 0.1F - 50F, creates oscillation effect and the slider value is directly
    proportional to the peak amplitude of oscillation means higher the value greater the
    oscillations will be.
</p>

<br>
<h3>Damping Coefficient</h3>

<p>
    Its range is same as of the rotational inertia and it adjusts the amount of time it is going to
    take to move the dial. The slider value is inversely proportional to the amount of time taken.
    Set the higher value to achieve smoother movements.
</p>

<br>
<h3>Coefficient of Magnetic Field</h3>

<p>
    Its range is 0.1 to 5000 and it adjusts the magnetic susceptibility of the compass, higher
    values will make the compass more responsive to the external field changes.
</p>

<br>

<p>
    If the values messes up use the reset button to restore the default properties of the compass.
    If compass disappears for some reason turn of the physical properties and report to developer
    for potential error cases.
