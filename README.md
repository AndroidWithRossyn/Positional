## Features yet to be added

   #### Most Priority
  - [x] ~~GPS information panel~~
  - [ ] Dark Mode - Providing options for skins made this part a bit complicated
  - [x] ~~Speedometer~~
  - [x] ~~A separate fragment for torch~~ <br/>
        <sub>not feasible for a GPS app</sub>

<br/>

## Known Issues (so far)
  - [x] ~~Rotation causes view to move back to first panel~~
  - [ ] Parallax sensor values are wrong sometimes
  - [x] ~~Dialer rotating back to it's original state sometimes causes resource and input lock~~
  - [x] ~~Updating sensor values in the background **Handler Thread** to free up the UI load~~ <br/>
      <sub>**(21 Oct, 2020)** - ~~Sensor values cannot be updated in the background thread as the updating UI from the background causes a significant UI lag and communication delay~~ <br/> (24 Oct, 2020) - Sensor values are now updated in background thread<sub>
